#Cosmetic Crosser

This project was made with angular2 on the front-end which is consuming a rails API. The goal was to allow users to cross-reference products/ingredients. 

Users can use this application to:
    - search by product name to find ingredients
    - search by ingredient name to find products
    - select multiple products to find common ingredients
    - select multiple ingredients to find common products
    
Making this information readily available can be useful for avoiding allergenic substances and identifying personal sensitivities. 

The API for this project can be found at:

Tech: Rails 5.0.0, Angular 2.0.0
